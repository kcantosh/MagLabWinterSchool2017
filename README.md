This is a practical exercise created for the Theory Winter School held at MagLab. 
It contains scripts to run QWalk H<sub>2</sub> jobs using wave functions constructed by hand.

The website is (or was) [at this website](https://nationalmaglab.org/news-events/events/for-scientists/winter-theory-school).

For a detailed guide through the tutorial, compile tutorial.tex using LaTeX; if you have it, just do:
~~~
pdflatex tutorial.tex
~~~

To run the examples, you will need to install QWalk and indicate the location of the binaries in runqmc.py. You will also need the python libraries matplotlib, scipy, numpy, seaborn, and pandas.
